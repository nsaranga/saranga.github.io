Karma there is not used in common parlance the same way a theologian might use, but it is a general term referring to someoneâ€™s destiny. The destiny in question is metaphysical such that it exists not as a proverb but as a real feature of reality. By this I mean that destiny or someoneâ€™s destiny is not just an idea or a theory about something, it is a feature of reality. I think there is a good argument to be made that we should not believe that destiny is real if we want an egalitarian, law abiding society. Let me be clear this is not an argument about whether destiny is actually a feature of reality, but whether we should believe that it is if we want our society to be egalitarian and generally law abiding.</p>
